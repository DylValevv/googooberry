WRITING DIALOGUES:
To make a scene write the scene name and end it with a semicolon. 
The following text is the dialogue. The dialogue must finish with a semicolon.
An arrow - ">" is how to dicate the next line within a scene. 

IMPORTANT: 
the speaker tags must be in the //SPEAKER-NAME//] format, and the text mesh pro for the dialogue must be named to match it
the speakers must be recognised in a global Dialogue Manager Object in the Scene
start dialogues using dialogue triggers, with the parameter matching the Scene Name it wishes to start
See the example below, scene1! Happy writing!;

SCENE1;

//BRIGHTSQUARE//]

<i>Give them to me]

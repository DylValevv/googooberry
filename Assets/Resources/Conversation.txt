Project Conversations

WRITING DIALOGUES:
To make a scene write the scene name and end it with a semicolon. 
The following text is the dialogue. The dialogue must finish with a semicolon.
A square bracket - "]" is how to dictate the next line within a scene. 

IMPORTANT: 
the speaker tags must be in the //SPEAKER-NAME//] format, and the text mesh pro for the dialogue must be named to match it
the speakers must be recognised in a global Dialogue Manager Object in the Scene
start dialogues using dialogue triggers, with the parameter matching the Scene Name it wishes to start
See the example below, scene1! Note you can add colors and bold writing to text with tags if desired. Feel free to bold, italicize, resize text, or move line breaks around for organization, 
the original text file won't care. Happy writing!

Possible scene naming convention: CORE0, CORE1, CORE2, CORE3 for different dialogue events, and the npc name, so like CORE0_ILA for a conversation with her;

;C.0.ODEI;
//Odei]
Ah, there's my favorite miner! I'm still counting all the <b>ilarka</b> shards from your last haul.]
Thanks to your work, we'll be able to make the whole town <b>moonsighted</b> in no time!]
Maybe then some of these freeloaders will be strong enough to actually help us out. . .]
//Mairu]
Glad to be of help.]
//Odei]
Hah, that's the spirit!]
 Speaking of which, I've got some leads on new <b>ilarka</b> deposits near town, meaning I got another job for you.]
Why don't you go pay Ila a visit over at her shrine first?]
 Despite all of her ravings about how these crystals are killin' us, her healing powers are a great way to prepare for an outing.]
Can't stand it, but that's why I got you to take the beating instead! Hah!]

;C.0.ODEI+;
//Odei]
You got those crystals yet?]
//Mairu]
Still working on it, boss.]
//Odei]
Alright, well, let's get a move-on. If you're having a tough time, try talking to Tilak. He might have something that could help.]

;C.0.ILA;
//Ila]
Welcome Mairu. How goes your harvesting of those blasted crystals?]
//Mairu]
Quite well, actually. The more <b>ilarka</b> we collect the closer we are to finally escaping this place.]
//Ila]
The <b>Teluna</b> will always be there, we will ascend it and find the moon in time. We don't need to rush it with the <b>moonsight</b>.]
Our ancestors had patience, and so can we.]
//Mairu]
Well, you're <b>moonsighted</b> too, Ila. What's not to like about this power?]
//Ila]
A blessing for you, but a curse for me. I'm glad you're happy with it.]
I take it you're preparing for another expedition?]
//Mairu]
Right you are. I'd appreciate a little patching up before heading out.]
//Ila]
Of course. . .]
//:FullHealCharacter]
Watch yourself out there, it's dangerous past the walls of our <b>Etsuna</b>.]
//Mairu]
Right. Take care Ila.]

;C.0.TILAK;
//Tilak]
Eyy Mairu! How's it hangin'?]
//Mairu]
Hey, not too bad Tilak! What're you cooking up today?]
//Tilak]
Oh, just the usual <b>onddargi</b> stew. Those little 'shrooms pack quite the punch of flavor!]
Although. . . I'm lookin' to make another batch of <b>ilarka</b> candy. More and more folks are looking to become <b>moonsighted</b>, and I gotta satisfy 'em.]
Speaking of which, are you and Odei bringin' in a new shipment of <b>ilarka</b> soon? I can't meet those demands without those crystals.]
//Mairu]
Yep, I'm just about to head out on another outing.]
//Tilak]
Alright! Just bring those crystals back to me and I can get cooking. I'll even give ya a lil' extra to boost your <b>moonsight</b> powers!
Actually, ya know what? I've got a bit of candy left over, why don't you take this now as an advanced thank-you?]
//:ActivatePlayerDash]
//Mairu]
Thanks, Tilak. I'll be back with that <b>ilarka</b> before you know it.]

;C.0.OLENT;
//Olent]
Ah, hello Mairu. That was quite the entrance there.]
//Mairu]
Olent? The town hasn't seen you in months!]
//Olent]
Yes, I do regret not visiting more. But I've found a peaceful life out here among the flora and fauna.]
You might learn to enjoy it too, if you spent more time enjoying this place than you do destroying it.]
//Mairu]
I can't rest easy here in these caves knowing that our true home lies up there, on the surface, under the moonlight.]
You of all people should know that.]
//Olent]
I may be old, but I've never seen the surface. The <b>Etsuna</b> is all I've known, same as you.]
And if I've learned anything, it's that we're better off trying to celebrate this beautiful place.]
Not risking our lives trying to find a home we've never known!]
//Mairu]
Alright, you can keep wandering around picking <b>onddargi</b>, I'll be looking for <b>ilarka</b> and actually getting things done.]
//Olent]
As you wish. If you must go on, please do mind the <b>Uskerra</b>. They're peaceful creatures, but the <b>ilarka</b> are their food source.]
If you keep consuming it, they're not going to be happy. . .]

;C.0.NPC1;
//Villager]
One of Odei's moonsighted, eh? You're lucky to have gotten it so soon.]

;C.0.NPC2;
//Villager]
Ila likes to pretend that she understands the common moth's issues.]
//Mairu]
She's pretending?]
//Villager]
Of course! Her father was the village leader, and she inherited his moonsight.]
She was born powerful. Odei's right. She'll never truly know the struggle.]

;C.0.NPC3;
//Villager]
I love staring at the slow sway of the mushrooms. What a peaceful glow they give off.]
//Mairu]
Not as good as the moon.]
//Villager] How can you know when you've never seen it?]
//Mairu]
I just know.]

;C.0.NPC4;
//Villager]
When I was small, I felt the <b>onddargi</b> give such a powerful glow. It seems they've dimmed.]
//Mairu]
Must be your eyes. You're getting old, after all.]
//Villager] Perhaps. . .]


;Core 1;
Themes, llarka doubt, ilarka craze, sides becoming more polarized, npc comments on mushrooms dimming, seasonal sadness type beat, start of an artificial winter

;C.1.ODEI;
//Odei] Keep that <b>ilarka</b> coming! This is what I like to see!]
//Mairu] When can we explore the <b>Teluna</b>? I think we're ready now.]
//Odei] Not so fast. We need the entire town <b>moonsighted</b> first.]
To feel the power of the <b>ilarka</b> coursing through my veins. . . I cannot wait.]
//Mairu] Why not become <b>moonsighted</b> now?]
//Odei] No no no, Mairu. That would be a bad image. Then I'd be no better than Ila.]
I need these non-<b>moonsighted</b> moths knowing I'm on their side, right?]

;C.1.TILAK;
//Tilak] Look at you, the hero of <b>Etsuna</b>! Another crystal for Mairu. Let me give it a look.] 
Oh, wow. This one's powerful, lots of raw <b>ilarka</b> energy. Let me cook it up.]
//:ScreenFade]
Alright, deals a deal. Some <b>ilarka</b> for the miner, and the rest for the village.]
I don't mean to brag but this looks to be some of my finest work. Eat up!]
//:ActivatePlayerProjectile]
//Mairu] Whew, that has a kick! Thanks, Tilak.]
 
;C.1.ILA;
//Ila] Another crystal destroyed, hmm?]
//Mairu] Sure thing. We're making progress, it's a good thing Ila.]
//Ila] I have an uneasy feeling about all this, Mairu. It's almost as if I hear the <b>onddargi's</b> whispers fading.]
//Mairu] Change is always uncertain. Sometimes you have to take a chance.] 
Without <b>moonsight</b>, we won't make it up the <b>Teluna</b>. Our true home, Ila, is up there. This is all temporary.]
//Ila] <i>This</i>, the <b>Etsuna</b>, is our home, Mairu, and I want to make sure it survives.]
//Mairu] And I want a future for us. We don't belong down here, and the <b>ilarka</b> are our way out.]
This is our best chance to leave. It's impossible without the <b>moonsight</b>.]
Not that you would know. You've never had to live without it.]
//:FullHealCharacter]
//Ila] You bear the gift of <b>moonsight</b>, yet you're still blinded by arrogance.]
I'll always be here to heal you, but you've clearly made up your mind. Tread with care.]

;C.1.OLENT;
//Olent] You're quite the explorer, aren't you?]
//Mairu] And the <b>Etsuna's</b> best miner.]
//Olent] The best at destroying this world.]
//Mairu] Why are you even out here?]
//Olent] Have you heard the story of how the town's leadership came to be?]
//Mairu] I was young, but I know of it. Odei promised progress and provided for the people.]
He cared about all of us and we made him our leader.]
//Olent] That's what they tell, yes. But I always believed Ila should have taken the village on, an unpopular opinion.]
//Mairu] Ila is not a leader. She never even asked for power.]
//Olent] And that is why she would be the best fit. Odei never cared for our people.]
The only thing he cares about is power and control. It is a pity you cannot see that.]
//Mairu] Someone had to do something. He's bringing the <b>moonsight</b> to everyone, so we can finally leave this place.
//Olent] And why must we be <b>moonsighted</b> to do so?]
I am an old moth, Mairu. My time to act has passed. I wish you wisdom in your path.] 
It is easy to be swept up in the excitement of change. I pray it does not consume you.]
As always, mind the Uskerra.]

;C.2.ODEI;
//Odei] Time is drawing near, Mairu. With these crystals, the preparations to convert the entire village are being made.]
Then we will begin to scale the <b>Teluna</b>. The birth of a new era!]
//Mairu] An exciting time to be alive.]
//Odei] Right you are! A birth of new equality, power and possibilities for all moths.]
Don't let up, we're almost there.]
//Mairu] What of the dimming <b>onddargi</b>? I've heard talk that we could run out of food.]
//Odei] I'm not worried! We'll be out of here soon enough, and have plenty to eat under the moonlight!]
Time to finish the job and move on!]
//Mairu] Right, of course.]

;C.2.TILAK;
//Tilak] Notice anything different?]
//Mairu] Tilak! This is amazing, look at you! <b>Moonsighted</b>! How is it?]
//Tilak] It's amazing! I feel alive, like a brand new moth. All thanks to you and your last find.]
And it seems like you got more for me. I never thought things could go this well.]
//Mairu] Doesn't seem like everyone's so happy.]
//Tilak] You mean Ila and the others? They're just a bit unnerved at the changes.]
Maybe Ila's feeling less powerful with all the new <b>moonsighted</b> moths, hah!]
Anyway, let me take a look at your new find . . .]
She's a beauty, probably your best find yet. This candy's going to have quite a kick, you ready?]
//Mairu] As I'll ever be. Let's see it.]
//:ScreenFade]
//Tilak] Here's your share. Careful with that one.]
//:ActivatePlayerSlam]
//Mairu] Woah. Ok, ok. . .]
//:ScreenFade]
//Tilak] Wow, that one really took you out! But you're glowing, baby! Go try that one out.]

 
;C.2.ILA;
//Mairu] Hey Ila, I -]
//:FullHealCharacter]
//Ila] I did my job. You're free to go.]
//Mairu] Everyone's going to be <b>moonsighted</b> soon, Ila. At least pretend to be happy about it.]
//Ila] I'll share the village's happiness, but moreso I mourn for our home.]
//Mairu] I know things have been tense, but . . . ]
I hope we can grow close again in the new world, above.]
//Ila] At this point, I truly hope things go as planned Mairu.]
There's no turning back now. I hope it's all worth it.]

;C.2.OLENT;
//Odei] You cannot deny a dark shroud that has surrounded the Etsuna.]
//Mairu] I don't. That is why we must finish the job and leave.]
//Olent] It has been the miner's destruction. That is why the Ondarggi cry out. The backbone of the caves, the Etsuna, our home.]
//Mairu] We will finish what we started, and the Etsuna will be a memory of the past once we reach the moon. It's time to return to the surface, Olent. We are going to leave.]
//Olent] No Mairu. This is my home, and yours too. I will stay here until the bitter end.]
//Mairu] So be it. Starve alone, Olent. You are stubborn until the end.]
//Olent] That makes two of us, doesn't it?]

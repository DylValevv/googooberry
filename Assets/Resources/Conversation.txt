Project Conversations

WRITING DIALOGUES:
To make a scene write the scene name and end it with a semicolon. 
The following text is the dialogue. The dialogue must finish with a semicolon.
A square bracket - "]" is how to dictate the next line within a scene. 

IMPORTANT: 
the speaker tags must be in the //SPEAKER-NAME//] format, and the text mesh pro for the dialogue must be named to match it
the speakers must be recognised in a global Dialogue Manager Object in the Scene
start dialogues using dialogue triggers, with the parameter matching the Scene Name it wishes to start
See the example below, scene1! Note you can add colors and bold writing to text with tags if desired. Feel free to bold, italicize, resize text, or move line breaks around for organization, 
the original text file won't care. Happy writing!

Possible scene naming convention: CORE0, CORE1, CORE2, CORE3 for different dialogue events, and the npc name, so like CORE0_ILA for a conversation with her;

;C.0.ODEI;
//Odei]
Ah, there's my favorite miner! I'm still counting all the <b>Ilarka</b> shards from your last haul.]
Thanks to your work, we'll be able to make the whole town <b>moonsighted</b> in no time!]
And then some of these freeloaders might be strong enough to actually help us out. . .]
//Mairu]
Glad to be of help.]
//Odei]
Hah, that's the spirit!]
 Speaking of which, I've got some leads on new <b>ilarka</b> deposits near town, meaning I got another job for you.]
Why don't you go pay Ila a visit over at her shrine first?]
 Despite all her ravings about how these crystals are killin' us, her healing powers are a great way to prepare for an outing.]
Just between you and me, I'd take any opportunity to skip a conversation with that one. Hah!]

;C.0.ODEI+;
//Odei]
You get those crystals yet?]
//Mairu]
Still working on it, boss.]
//Odei]
Alright, well, let's get a move-on. If you're having a tough time, try talking to Tilak. He might have something that could help.]

;C.0.ILA;
//Ila]
Welcome Mairu. How goes your harvesting of those blasted crystals?]
//Mairu]
Quite well, actually. The more <b>ilarka</b> we collect the closer we can get to flying up that tunnel and finally escaping this place.]
//Ila]
The <b>Teluna</b> will always be there, we will ascend it and find the moon in time. We don't need to rush it with the <b>moonsight</b>.]
Our ancestors had patience, and so can we.]
//Mairu]
Well, you're <b>moonsighted</b> too, Ila. What's not to like about this power?]
//Ila]
It is my curse to bear. I'm glad you are happy with it.]
I take it you're preparing for another expedition?]
//Mairu]
Right you are. I'd appreciate a little patching up before heading out.]
//Ila]
Of course.]
//:FullHealCharacter]
Please be careful. It's dangerous out there, past the walls of our <b>Etsuna</b>.]
//Mairu]
Right. Take care Ila.]

;C.0.TILAK;
//Tilak]
Eyy Mairu! How's it hangin'?]
//Mairu]
Hey, not too bad Tilak! What're you cooking up today?]
//Tilak]
Oh, just the usual <b>onddargi</b> stew. Those little 'shrooms pack quite the punch of flavor!]
Although . . . I'm lookin' to make another batch of <b>ilarka</b> candy. More and more folks are looking to become <b>moonsighted</b>, and I gotta satisfy 'em.]
On that note ... you and Odei bringin' in a new shipment of <b>ilarka</b> soon? I need those crystals to make more of my world-famous candy!]
//Mairu]
Yep, I'm just about to head out on another outing.]
//Tilak]
Marvelous. Just bring those crystals back to me and I can get cooking. I'll even hook you up with a little extra to boost your <b>moonsight</b> powers!
Actually, ya know what? I've got a little bit of candy left over, why don't you take this now as an advanced thank-you?]
//:ActivatePlayerFinisher]
//Mairu]
Thanks, Tilak. I'll be back with that <b>ilarka</b> before you know it.]

;C.0.OLENT;
//Olent]
Ah, hello Mairu. That was quite the entrance there.]
//Mairu]
Olent? The town hasn't seen you in months!]
//Olent]
Yes, I do regret not visiting more. But I've found life out here, among the flora and fauna, to be much more peaceful.]
You might learn to enjoy it too, if you spent more time enjoying this place than you do destroying it.]
//Mairu]
I can't rest easy here in these caves knowing that our true home lies up there, on the surface, under the moonlight.]
You of all people should know that.]
//Olent]
I may be old, but I've never seen the surface. The <b>Etsuna</b> is all I've known, same as you.]
And if I've learned anything, it's that we're better off trying to make a life in this beautiful place.]
Not risking ourselves trying to find a home we've never known.]
//Mairu]
Alright, you can keep wandering around picking <b>onddargi</b>, I'll be looking for <b>ilarka</b> and actually getting things done.]
//Olent]
As you wish. If you must go on, please do mind the <b>Uskerra</b>. They're peaceful creatures, but the <b>ilarka</b> are their food source.]
If you keep taking it, they're not going to be happy. . .]

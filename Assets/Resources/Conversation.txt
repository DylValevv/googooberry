Project Conversations

WRITING DIALOGUES:
To make a scene write the scene name and end it with a semicolon. 
The following text is the dialogue. The dialogue must finish with a semicolon.
An squarebracket - "]" is how to dicate the next line within a scene. 

IMPORTANT: 
the speaker tags must be in the //SPEAKER-NAME//] format, and the text mesh pro for the dialogue must be named to match it
the speakers must be recognised in a global Dialogue Manager Object in the Scene
start dialogues using dialogue triggers, with the parameter matching the Scene Name it wishes to start
See the example below, scene1! Note you can add colors and bold writing to text with tags if desired. Feel free to bold, italicize, resize text, or move line breaks around for organization, 
the original text file won’t care. Happy writing!

Possible scene naming convention: CORE0, CORE1, CORE2, CORE3 for different dialogue events, and the npc name, so like CORE0_ILA for a conversation with her;

Project Conversations

WRITING DIALOGUES:
To make a scene write the scene name and end it with a semicolon. 
The following text is the dialogue. The dialogue must finish with a semicolon.
An squarebracket - "]" is how to dicate the next line within a scene. 

IMPORTANT: 
the speaker tags must be in the //SPEAKER-NAME//] format, and the text mesh pro for the dialogue must be named to match it
the speakers must be recognised in a global Dialogue Manager Object in the Scene
start dialogues using dialogue triggers, with the parameter matching the Scene Name it wishes to start
See the example below, scene1! Note you can add colors and bold writing to text with tags if desired. Feel free to bold, italicize, resize text, or move line breaks around for organization, 
the original text file won't care. Happy writing!

Possible scene naming convention: CORE0, CORE1, CORE2, CORE3 for different dialogue events, and the npc name, so like CORE0_ILA for a conversation with her;

//Odei]
Another crystal harvested, you might be my favorite little moth. Wow, what a workhorse! Amazing. The village will be completely moon-sighted soon enough.]

//Mairu]
Yeah.]

//Odei]
Tight-lipped as always, hah! You look a bit hurt, but not too bad. You could visit the village crazy under the shrine to get healed up.]

<i> But between you and me, I'd take any opportunity to skip a conversation with that one. <i>]

;C.0.ILA;

//Mairu]
Hey, Ila.]

//Ila]
Need a heal, I assume?]

//Mairu]
Need? No.]
But it'd be nice.]

//Ila]
Of course it would. I can't remember the last time you came just to chat.]

//Mairu]
Well, that's only because you're such a downer.]

//Ila]
I'll pretend I didn't hear that one.]

//:FullHealCharacter]
Run along.]

;C.0.TILAK;

//Tilak]
Ah, it's the fucker.]

//Mairu]
You mean the guy who just got another crystal for town?]

//Tilak]
Hah! But where would you be without me?]

//Mairu]
Probably enjoying my life 200% more.]

//Tilak]
Lies, lies! I know you love me.]

//Mairu]
Love's a rather strong word.]

//Tilak]
Alright, alright big guy, here's your prize.]
//:ActivatePlayerFinisher]

//Mairu]
Thanks Tilak, keep it real.]

//Tilak]
Couldn't live any other way. By the way, the big guy wants to speak with you again.]

//Mairu] Odei? Got it, thanks for the heads up.]

;C.0.ODEI+;

//Odei]
Work's not done yet.]

//Mairu]
Of course. Wouldn't have it any other way.]

//Odei]
The next Ilarkia crystal lies beyond that tunnel there. You should be able to get through with your finisher. Go for it.]

;C.0.OLENT;

//Olent]
I heard you enter with quite a bang, Mairu.]

//Mairu]
I don't have time for the subtleties. I'm on the job.]

//Olent]
Odei still has you running in circles it seems.]

//Mairu]
You can see it how you wish to, but I live my own life.]

//Olent]
Well, I'm concerned for all moths, moon-sighted or not. So let me tell you this.]
All that crystal you've been eating, you might like it, but so do the Uskerra. They'll leave me alone, but you - they'll tear you to shreds if they can. They're just beyond this tunnel.]

//Mairu]
I can deal. No need to be concerned for me.]

//Olent]
Whatever you say.]

//Mairu]
But thank you for the tip. I hope you come back to the village, we'd love to have you.]

//Olent]
Well that's unexpectedly thoughtful, Mairu, but that's not how everyone feels. Thank you for the kind words, but I'll pass.];
